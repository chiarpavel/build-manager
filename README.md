# build-manager

Basic Unity build management

version 0.1.0

This package should deal with version and build information for you, incrementing the build number automatically and modifying the appropriate fields for each platform.
You also get a one-click build, useful if you regularly build for multiple platforms at once, say Android and iOS.
